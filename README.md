## üéØ Our Mission

**C2 Browser puts users first, always.**

We believe every user deserves a browser that respects their privacy, gives them control, and listens to their needs. While the browser landscape is filled with options, each comes with compromises that put corporate interests above user interests.

## üåê The Browser Landscape Problem

We've looked across the entire browser ecosystem, and here's what we found:

### Big Tech Browsers
- **Chrome, Safari, Edge**: Corporate surveillance machines designed to extract your data
- **Firefox & Firefox-based browsers**: Lack essential features like proper developer tools that developers actually want to use

### Chromium Forks
- **Arc**: Excellent browser, but closed-source and prioritizes company interests over users
- **Vivaldi**: Feature-rich but closed-source with unclear motives
- **Most others**: Each has their own agenda that doesn't align with user needs

### The Exception
- **Zen Browser**: Truly puts users first and we highly recommend it! However, it's Firefox-based and inherits Firefox's limitations

## ü§ù Our Relationship with Zen Browser

**C2 Browser is the spiritual brother of Zen Browser** (though not technically related). We share the same core philosophy: **users first, always**.

While Zen focuses on the Firefox ecosystem, we're building the Chromium equivalent - giving users the best of both worlds: Chromium's superior developer tools and performance with a user-first philosophy.

## üèóÔ∏è Built on Strong Foundations

C2 Browser is **proudly based on [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)**, and we support their mission wholeheartedly.

### Our Heritage
ungoogled-chromium itself builds upon excellent work from:
- [Inox patchset](https://github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset)
- [Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite)
- [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/chromium)
- [Iridium Browser](https://iridiumbrowser.de/)
- [Helium Browser](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-chromium/)

**This is where C2 Browser differs fundamentally** - we will always listen to and prioritize our users' needs.

## ‚ú® What Makes C2 Different

### User-First Philosophy
- **Community-driven development**: Your voice shapes our roadmap
- **Transparent decision-making**: All major decisions discussed openly with the community
- **No corporate agenda**: We're not trying to monetize your data or push corporate interests

### Technical Excellence
- **Chromium-based**: Superior developer tools and web compatibility
- **Privacy-hardened**: Built on ungoogled-chromium's privacy-first foundation
- **Open source**: Full transparency, community auditable
- **User-controlled**: Extensive customization options
